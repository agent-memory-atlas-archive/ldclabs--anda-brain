/**
 * Re-syncs everything this repository vendors from `anda_kip`.
 *
 * Two kinds of file, and the difference is why this script exists.
 *
 * **Verbatim.** The role cards, `KIPSyntax.md` and
 * `CognitiveMemoryProfile-2.0.md` are the protocol's, not ours. The Rust service
 * reads them straight out of the crate (`agents::prompts::mode_reference()` and
 * `memory_runtime`), so it keeps no copy. `@ldclabs/kip-do` ships none of them,
 * so the Worker keeps copies — and a copy nobody can refresh is how a model
 * ends up writing against a contract that moved.
 *
 * **Half ours.** Each `Brain*.md` is the KIP 2.0 reference policy for one mode
 * plus a section A describing *this* deployment. The reference half is
 * upstream's and must track it; section A is ours and must survive. Splitting
 * on the `# A.` heading lets both be true, which the previous "diff them by
 * hand when the reference policies change" note did not: between KIP 2.0
 * `40e655f` landing and this script, Watch, WorkingState, DerivationState,
 * `MnemonicState.utility`, `LIST DEPENDENTS` and `PURGE PAYLOAD` were in the
 * reference policies and in none of our five copies of them.
 *
 * Uses the sibling `anda-db` checkout by default. Set `ANDA_KIP_SOURCE` to an
 * `anda_kip` crate directory to sync against a published release instead.
